This is an Android Quuppa tag emulation sample app. It's primary purpose is to demonstrate the usage of [Quuppa Tag emulation library for Android](https://github.com/quuppalabs/android-quuppa-taglib).

## Getting started

Clone the project and open it in Android studio. Depending on your IDE and groovy version, you may need to adjust gradle-wrapper.properties. We use old gradle and gradle android tools for maximum compatibility.
