# Android Quuppa Tag Demo

This is a Quuppa tag emulation sample app for Android. It's primary purpose is to demonstrate the usage of the [Quuppa Tag emulation library for Android](https://github.com/quuppalabs/android-quuppa-taglib).

## Getting Started

Clone the project and open it in Android Studio. Depending on your IDE and Groovy version, you may need to adjust the gradle-wrapper.properties. We use fairly old versions of Gradle and Gradle Android tools for maximum compatibility. Once the build succeeds, you should be able to install the resulting apk (in build/outputs/apk/debug/) to your devices with [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb). Some base knowledge of Android development is expected.
